### digital-image-forgery-detection
The project focuses on developing a robust system for classification of images as forged or authentic where the images are forged with copy-move forgery and various post-processing operations are applied to them to make the forgery look convincing. It was completed in July 2019.

The method uses Median Filter Residual of second order, Average Filter Residual and Noise Features extracted by the SRM filter as combined inputs to train a deep CNN model.

For a test set of 2800 images, the model predicts with 95% accuracy and 0.953 f1 score.
